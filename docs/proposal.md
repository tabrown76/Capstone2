# Meal Decision Maker/Meal Planning Application Proposal

## 1. Tech Stack
- **Front-End**: React.js
- **Back-End**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for Google and Facebook sign-in
- **Additional Libraries/Frameworks**: React-Spring (animations), Axios (API requests)

## 2. Focus of the Project
The project will be a full-stack application with an equal focus on both front-end and back-end. The front-end will prioritize an engaging user interface and interactive features, while the back-end will handle data management, API integration, and authentication.

## 3. Platform
This project will be developed as a responsive web application, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## 4. Project Goal
The goal is to provide a user-friendly platform for discovering new recipes, planning meals, generating shopping lists, and integrating with grocery delivery services, thereby streamlining the meal planning process.

## 5. User Demographics
The application targets a wide range of users, including busy professionals, families, and individuals seeking efficient meal planning and culinary inspiration, focusing on tech-savvy and health-conscious demographics.

## 6. Data Usage and Collection
- **Recipe Data**: Integration with a comprehensive recipe API for a diverse range of recipes.
- **User Data**: Stored in PostgreSQL; includes user preferences, meal plans, and shopping lists.
- **OAuth Data**: For secure user authentication.
- **Grocery Delivery Service API**: Linking shopping lists to services like Instacart.
- **Custom API**: (For Python/Flask stack) Developing a custom API, potentially involving web scraping.

## 7. Approach to Creating the Project
- **Database Schema**:
  - User: { userID, email, passwordHash, preferences, mealPlans, shoppingLists }
  - Recipe: { recipeID, title, ingredients, instructions, dietaryRestrictions, cuisineType }
- **API Challenges**:
  - Ensuring reliable and fast responses from external APIs.
  - Managing inconsistent data formats (for custom API).
- **Security**:
  - Secure handling of authentication tokens and user data.
  - Environment variables for sensitive info like API keys.
- **App Functionality**:
  - User authentication, recipe search/filtering, meal planning, shopping list generation, grocery delivery service integration.
- **User Flow**:
  - Sign-in/up → Recipe discovery → Recipe search with filters → Meal planning → Shopping list creation → Grocery delivery service option.
- **Stretch Goals and Advanced Features**:
  - AI-based recipe recommendation.
  - Nutritional information tracking.
  - User-generated recipe uploads and community features.
